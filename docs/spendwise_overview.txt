## The Problem SpendWise Solves

Most people struggle with three major financial problems:

First, they don't know where their money goes. Every month, money disappears into countless small purchases, subscriptions, and expenses that are hard to track.

Second, they consistently overspend. Without a clear system to monitor spending limits, it's easy to exceed what you can afford in categories like food, entertainment, or shopping.

Third, they fail to save consistently. People want to save for goals like vacations, new phones, or emergency funds, but without tracking progress, saving gets pushed to "next month" indefinitely.

SpendWise addresses all three problems in one app, with the added power of AI-driven personalized advice.

## App Screens and Features

SpendWise has 7 main tabs: Dashboard, Transactions, Insights, Reports, Budget, Goals, and Settings.

### Dashboard Screen

The Dashboard is the home screen that shows your complete financial picture at a glance.

At the top, you see your current balance with total income, total expenses, and savings for the current month.

Below that is a weekly spending chart that visualizes your spending patterns over the last 7 days. The chart updates in real-time whenever you add new transactions.

At the bottom, recent transactions are displayed for quick reference. You can tap any transaction to view or edit it.

A floating plus button allows you to quickly add new transactions from anywhere in the app.

### Transactions Screen

The Transactions screen shows your complete financial history with all income and expenses.

Two filter buttons at the top let you view only Income or only Expenses.

Notifications can be enabled for each budget to alert users at 80% usage as a warning and at 100% when the limit is reached.

### AI Insights Screen - The Unique Feature

The Insights screen is powered by Groq's LLaMA 3.3 70B Versatile model, making SpendWise unique among finance apps.

At the top is the Financial Health Score displayed in a circular badge. This is a number from 0 to 100 that represents your overall financial health. The score is calculated by the AI based on:
- Your savings rate
- Budget usage
- Goal progress
- Spending patterns

Score colors:
- Green (70-100): Excellent financial health
- Yellow (40-69): Moderate, needs attention
- Red (0-39): Poor, urgent action needed

Below the score is a Quick Tip section that shows a random helpful financial tip each time you visit.

The AI Insights section shows personalized cards with four types:
1. Success insights (green): Positive achievements like "Great job! You saved 35% this month"
2. Warning insights (amber): Alerts like "Your food budget is at 90%"
3. Tips (blue): Suggestions like "Try the 50/30/20 rule"
4. Info insights (gray): General observations

Each insight card has an emoji icon, a title, and a detailed message.

The Recommendations section shows 3 actionable tips from the AI based on your actual financial data. These are numbered 1, 2, 3 and explain specific steps you can take.

A "Get New Insights" button refreshes the AI analysis with your latest data.

The AI analyzes:
- Monthly income total
- Monthly expense total
- Savings rate percentage
- Spending by each category
- Budget usage percentages for each budget
- Goal progress and days remaining

This is not generic advice - the AI receives your actual numbers and provides personalized recommendations.

### Reports Screen

The Reports screen provides visual analytics for understanding spending patterns.

A time range selector lets you choose: Weekly, Monthly, or Yearly views.

The Pie Chart shows expense breakdown by category. Each slice represents a category with its color, showing what percentage of spending goes to each category.

The Bar Chart shows daily spending trends, helping you identify which days you spend more.

Below the charts, summary statistics show:

## What Makes SpendWise Unique

Most expense trackers just show you data. SpendWise actually thinks about your data.

The AI doesn't give generic tips like "save more money." It analyzes YOUR specific income, expenses, budgets, and goals to tell you exactly what's working and what needs attention.

Every time you refresh the Insights screen, the AI looks at your latest transactions and provides updated, personalized advice.

The Financial Health Score gives you a single number to track your overall financial wellbeing, like a fitness score but for your money.
