SPENDWISE APK BUILD INSTRUCTIONS
========================================

EASIEST METHOD (5 minutes):
----------------------------

1. Open PowerShell in the expo-app folder

2. Run: eas login
   - If you don't have an account, go to https://expo.dev/signup
   - Create a FREE account (takes 30 seconds)
   - Enter your email and password when prompted

3. Run: eas build --platform android --profile preview

4. Wait 10-20 minutes for the build to complete

5. You'll get a download link - click it to download your APK

6. Transfer APK to your Android phone and install


ALTERNATIVE: Use My Pre-Built APK
----------------------------------
I've already extracted all the code. You can:

1. Use the existing mobile/SpendWise-v1.0.2.apk in the parent folder
   OR
2. Use web/SpendWise-v1.0.2.apk

These are already built and ready to install!


WHY I CAN'T BUILD FOR YOU:
---------------------------
- EAS build requires YOUR Expo account login
- I cannot access your credentials
- The build must be done from your machine with your account


WHAT I'VE DONE:
---------------
✅ Extracted all React Native code from the website
✅ Created complete Expo project structure
✅ Installed all dependencies
✅ Set up Firebase configuration
✅ Created all screens (Dashboard, Transactions, Budgets, Goals, Settings)
✅ Installed EAS CLI globally on your machine


WHAT YOU NEED TO DO:
--------------------
Just 2 commands:
1. eas login
2. eas build --platform android --profile preview

That's it!


NEED HELP?
----------
If you get stuck:
1. Make sure you're in the expo-app folder
2. Make sure you have internet connection
3. Create Expo account at expo.dev if you don't have one
4. Run the 2 commands above
